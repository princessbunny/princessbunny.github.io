                <span class="behavior">Flopping:</span> A bunny at ease will often flop in contentment. 
                Sometimes there’s a buildup to the flop as a bunny turns his/her head a few times before finally rolling over completely onto his/her side.</br>
                <span class="behavior">Growling:</span> Grunting or growling is a sign your rabbit is angry or stressed. You may be invading their territory, and they’re telling you to back off. 
                Aggressive behavior will most likely ensue, so watch out.</br>
                <span class="behavior">Chinning:</span> Chinning is a rabbit’s way of saying, “Mine!” They rub their chin, which has special scent glands, on objects to mark their territory.</br>
                <span class="behavior">Licking:</span> Bunnies show affection by licking (grooming). You’ll often see pairs of rabbits grooming each other, which demonstrates they have a strong bond.</br>
                <span class="behavior">Chinning Nose Bonking / Nudging:</span> 
                Rabbits explore their environment by sniffing and nudging. It may be a greeting or their first line of investigation.
                Sometimes if the nudge is ignored, they follow up with a nip.</br>

               <div id="food1">Around 80% of a rabbit's diet should be grass or hay (dried grass). The rest is made up of a combination of fresh foods (e.g. vegetables and plants) 
                   and commerical dry food (e.g. pellets/nuggets). Select the foods below to learn more about each.</div></br>
